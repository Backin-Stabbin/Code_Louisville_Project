This is my Code Louisville C# Final Project.

Demonstrates understanding of C# in use with SQLite

Requirements:
- SQlite must be installed for it to operate.
- Built with .NET Core

What does it do?
- Create and Delete a SQLIte Database
- Adds and Selects data from SQL Database
- Allows changing of computer names when importing

First Time Launching Application?
- Database is missing. You must create one.
- Then import CSV and Choose a new computer name
- Try add a DB record and viewing the data
- Close application and reopen. Data is still available
- Try deleting DB. Did it go away?
